inoventory UI

Running at: http://10.100.253.181/

## Web Version

If running the web version, the run configuration must be edited so that the app starts at port 50000. 

This is done by editing the run configuration in Android Studio and adding the commandline argument next to ´additional run args´:
´--web-port=50000´
